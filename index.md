## About SEScore

Welcome to our project page, dedicated to our family of innovative reference-based text-generation evaluation metrics. 

### SEScore
*SEScore* is a reference-based text-generation evaluation metric that requires no pre-human-annotated error data, described in our paper [Not All Errors are Equal: Learning Text Generation Metrics using Stratified Error Synthesis.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05035) from EMNLP 2022. Reader can refer [https://research.google/pubs/pub51897/](https://research.google/pubs/pub51897/) for our WMT22 results!

Its effectiveness over prior methods like BLEU, BERTScore, BARTScore, PRISM, COMET and BLEURT has been demonstrated on a diverse set of language generation tasks, including translation, captioning, and web text generation. and we are very excited to share it with you!

### SEScore2

Building upon the solid foundation laid by SEScore, we then introduced SEScore2. This unsupervised model further innovates by synthesizing realistic model mistakes through the perturbation of sentences retrieved from a corpus. A key strength of SEScore2 lies in its flexibility to be extended to numerous languages, while simultaneously offering trustworthy severity estimation. These advancements are detailed in our paper [SESCORE2: Learning Text Generation Evaluation via Synthesizing Realistic Mistake.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09305).
