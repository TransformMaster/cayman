## Usage
There are two ways to use InstructScore.

### Option 1: Have a fast try through Huggingface
We have uploaded our model to Huggingface, which can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/xu1998hz/InstructScore).
You can directly try InstructScore via several lines of code:

```python
from InstructScore import InstructScore

refs = ["Normally the administration office downstairs would call me when thereâ€™s a delivery."]
outs = ["Usually when there is takeaway, the management office downstairs will call."]

scorer = InstructScore()
batch_explanations, batch_scores = scorer.score(refs, outs)
```

### Option 2: Download weight from Google Drive

You can also download the checkpoint from this Google Drive [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1seBqoewWHgu7I_AmZ6FE-_3EcJ3mGWQ2?usp=sharing).
